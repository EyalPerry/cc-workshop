❯ i want to create a claude code workshop which takes users along a story of creating a simple web app using claude code. the workshop should be interactive and guide users step-by-step through the process of building the app while teaching them about key features of claude code. please help me draft a narrative for the workshop that includes the main sections and topics to be covered.

In this workshop we will develop an automated CC setup which will do it’s best to
settings.json
statusline script
Write Review Friendly Code using .claude/rules
context7 mcp and how to make claude invoke it

Self validate against Project Rules (proactively keyword + skill)
Safety and automation: Automate Workflows with skills and self authored scripts (git push --force, git reset)
Pacing Claude with an implementation roadmap.
Conserve context by using subagents and CLAUDE.md files - for adding a feature to an existing project

Fundamentals we will cover in this session
CLAUDE.md file(s) in each folder of the project code

i want this to happen while a from sccratch project is developed., think about each             
  chapters and it's position               


i want it to be structured like a problem + solution narrative where each section introduces a challenge or requirement in building the web app, and then demonstrates how to use Claude Code features to address it.

let's focus the project around a python fastapi backend

context refinement. dont converse with claude when inconsistency is detected, clarify the ambiguity in the prompt file, and tell claude "requirements changed, please re-evaluate"

change up the structure: chapters folder contains the chapter.md - problem statement& user      
  prompt and the file system of the solution- before and after the fix. basically you take        
  chapter x-1, copy it over, run the prompt and this is the before, then fix the fs and this is   
  the after
