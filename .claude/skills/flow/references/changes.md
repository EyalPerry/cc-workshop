# Change Documentation Guidelines
Change documentation message must start with the issue id, followed by the branch suffix. Both can be extracted from the branch name.
Examples:
- for branch name `<something>/PROJ-123-add-login` or `PROJ-123-add-login`, the issue id is `PROJ-123` and the suffix is `add login`.
- for branch name `<something>/123-update-settings` or `123-add-login`, the issue id is `123` and the suffix is `update settings`. 

Generate a message according to the following guidelines:
- First line: `<issue-id>`
- Second line: `<branch-suffix>` (text after issue ID, with hyphens/underscores replaced by spaces)
- Third line: *blank line*
- Subsequent lines: <message body>

## Composing a Message
- Use imperative mood
- Be concise yet descriptive
- Summarize the changes made
- Avoid vague phrasing like "update" or "fix"
- If multiple files are changed, consider summarizing the overall purpose of the changes
- If multiple files are changed, you **MUST ALWAYS** summarize the overall purpose of the changes instead of a file by file list
- Where applicable, include a per file summary of changes made.
- In your message, group changes according to the categories listed below, in the specified order.

## Categories
1) Bug Fixes
2) New Features
3) Performance Improvements
