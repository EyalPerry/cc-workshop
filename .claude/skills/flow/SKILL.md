description: Use this skill proactively when the user asks you to commit, checkpoint or squash.

# Squash
If the user explicitly instructs you to squash, use `./references/squash.md` to guide your actions.

# Commit
If the user explicitly instructs you to commit, use `./references/commit.md` to guide your actions.

# Checkpoint
When the user asks you to checkpoint, use `./references/checkpoint.md` to guide your actions.

## Success Criteria
- Only execute checkpoint when the user requests you to checkpoint.
- Only execute squash when explicitly instructed by the user to squash commits.
- Only execute compact when explicitly instructed by the user to compact the branch.
- Only execute kickoff when explicitly instructed by the user to kick off a branch.
